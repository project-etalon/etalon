<summary><b> PR Checklist (Click to Expand) </b></summary>

<p>Thank you for your contribution to etalon! Before submitting the pull request, please ensure the PR meets the following criteria. This helps etalon maintain the code quality and improve the efficiency of the review process.</p>

<h3>PR Title and Classification</h3>
<p>Only specific types of PRs will be reviewed. The PR title is prefixed appropriately to indicate the type of change. Please use one of the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>[Bugfix]</code> for bug fixes.</li>
    <li><code>[CI/Build]</code> for build or continuous integration improvements.</li>
    <li><code>[Doc]</code> for documentation fixes and improvements.</li>
    <li><code>[Model]</code> for adding a new model or improving an existing model. Model name should appear in the title.</li>
    <li><code>[Profiling]</code> For changes on the profiling module. </li>
    <li><code>[Core]</code> for changes in the core simulator logic </li>
    <li><code>[Misc]</code> for PRs that do not fit the above categories. Please use this sparingly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the PR spans more than one category, please include all relevant prefixes.</p>

<h3>Code Quality</h3>

<p>The PR need to meet the following code quality standards:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Pass all linter checks. Please use <code>make format</code></a> to format your code.</li>
    <li>The code need to be well-documented to ensure future contributors can easily understand the code.</li>
    <li>Please add documentation to <code>docs/source/</code> if the PR modifies the user-facing behaviors of etalon. It helps user understand and utilize the new features or changes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes for Large Changes</h3>
<p>Please keep the changes as concise as possible. For major architectural changes (>500 LOC), we would expect a GitHub issue (RFC) discussing the technical design and justification. Otherwise, we will tag it with <code>rfc-required</code> and might not go through the PR.</p>

<h3>Thank You</h3>

<p> Finally, thank you for taking the time to read these guidelines and for your interest in contributing to etalon. Your contributions make etalon a great tool for everyone! </p>
